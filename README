                           SCRIPT3 (script tree)
                           =====================

Script3 (also shortened as s3) is a structure for keeping (mainly) scripts
organized.

The design goals were:

* All scripts should be as small as possible
* Do only one thing per script
* Be reusable, both in terms of themselves and with reusable functions
* Be easy to find when eding them (all becomes links in ~/bin, open all in kate)
* Differ function from UI to adid maintain-/readability (OOP pattern inspired)
* Ability to differ between FOSS and propietory code (this is mainy why it's now
  managed by repo).
* Coexist with other s3 instances

S3 will differ in ability depending on which packages are installed. These are
managed by manifests, either in this git or in another. Note that the
mainfest-git does not have to reside on this server to use the script3-* gits.

Installation:
=============

mkdir yourdir
cd yourdir

repo init \
	-u https://github.com/mambrus/script3.git \
	-b public \
	-m public/standard.xml

repo sync

s3/install_all.sh

That's it! The probably most important commands you'll need from now on is

s3.install_s3.sh	- Installs a s3 file
s3.install_all.sh	- Installs everything from the directory you stand at and
					  below
s3.ssh_keygen.sh	- Establish ssh key-exchange betwen a server and client

To uninstall:
=============

s3.uninstall_all.sh


Or if you have installations from several different s3 repositories the
following will expicitly uninstall from the right one:

cd ${UNINSTALL_THIS_S3}
s3/uninstall_all.sh


Adding your own s3's (the s3 way):
==================================
(Note that s3 accept having any script in it's tree. Follow these guildelines if
you want them to coexist in terms of the design-goals above)
 
S3 will install scripts organized by name-space. Say thet you have a script
stored in: 

./script3/gen/user-response.sh

... this will be installed as ~/bin/gen.user-response.sh

Using it in CLI mode will be logical and tab-able.

You can also organize your scripts according to organization. For example:

./script3/com/yourorg/you/gen/user/response.sh

Which will be used as com.yourorg.you.gen.user.sh

The finally installed file-names will quit long, but still locically organized, fast & easy to find & use, which is VERY useful particulary when writing script libraries (which S3 is all about).

Hints:
======
Bowse and edit all S3's regardless of which repo they belong tow ith Kate Toolbar button. Copy & paste the following into a terminal:

bash -ic "cd ~/bin; kate -s AllMyBin $( (ls *.sh; ls *.tcl; ls *.py; ls *.awk;\
ls *.pl; ls *.exp; ls *.gdb; ls *.cfg; ls *.ctags) | sort ) "

To create files.s3 manually:
---------------------------
DIRS=$( find . -type d | egrep -v '\.git' ); for D in $DIRS; do \
      (    cd $D; ls -F | \
           grep -v README | \
           grep -v 'files\.s3' | \
           egrep '\*$' | \
           sed -e 's/\*$//' > files.s3 \
      );  done


How to begin writing new scripts:
--------------------------------

Best and easiest way is to start with another script and use this one as a
template. There is a script helping you copy and rename vital parts of the
template:

futils.s3template

run it with -h option for a full description of how to use it.
