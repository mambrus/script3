                           SCRIPT3 (script tree)
                           =====================

Script3 (also shortened as s3) is a structure for keeping (mainly) scripts
organized.

The construction goals were:

* All scripts should be as small as possible
* Do only one thing per script
* Be reusable, both in terms of themselves and with reusable functions
* Be easy to find when eding them (all becomes links in ~/bin, open all in kate)
* Differ function from UI to adid maintain-/readability (OOP pattern inspired)
* Ability to differ between FOSS and propietory code (this is mainy why it's now
* managed by repo).

S3 wil. differ in ability depending on which packages are installed. These are
managed by manifests, either in this git or in another. Note that the
mainfest-git does not have to reside on this server to use the script3-* gits.

To get started:

mkdir yourdir
cd yourdir

repo init \
	-u git@github.com:mambrus/script3.git \
	-b master \
	-m public/standard.xml

repo sync

s3/install_all.sh
