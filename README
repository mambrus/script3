                           SCRIPT3 (script tree)
						   =====================

Script3 (also shortened as s3) is a structure for keeping (mainly) scripts
organized.

The construction goals were:

* All scripts should be as small as possible
* Do only one thing per script
* Be reusable, both in terms of themselves and with reusable functions
* Be easy to find when eding them (all becomes links in ~/bin, open all in kate)
* Differ function from UI to adid maintain-/readability (OOP pattern inspired)
